Java Hangman


This game was built using intellij and java, it is the first java project I have attempted and I am proud of how it works!

The game works by a random word being generated and the player has to take guesses as to which letters the word contains. For each correct guess the letter will fill in the blank underscore associated to it and the player will be prompted to guess again until all letters have been successfully guessed and they will be given the option to play again.

If a player guesses incorrectly they will lose a life and then again, be prompted to take another guess. This will continue until the player either wins the game as mentioned above or they run out of lives and lose the game.

A feature which I initially struggled to get working was getting the randomly generated word to be converted into underscores, each being associated to the correct letter, however I managed to get this working which I am very happy with. 

In the future I will look into adding a more interesting display for the player including a hangman drawing which grows with each incorrect answer.
